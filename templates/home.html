	<p>Liver disease averts the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol consumption liver disease arises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms is an efficacious task that can help the doctors to dianose the disease within a short duration of time. Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctors. The main objective of this paper is analyse the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare the predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease. This paper focuses on the related works of various authors on liver disease such that algorithms were implemented using Weka toolthat is a machine learing software written in JAVA. Various attributes that are essential in the prediction of liver disease were examined and the dataset of liver patients were also evaluated. This paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Separation Algorithm with an aim to identifythe best technique. Based on this study, Random Forest with the highest accuracy outperformed the other algorithms and can be further utilised in the porediction of liver disease commended.
